<h2> Abstracts </h2> 

<p> <a name=schober> </a> <strong> Bernd Schober (Universit&auml;t Oldenburg): Polyhedral invariants for desingularization. </strong> The goal of my talk is to present a convex geometric viewpoint on singularities and their resolution. More precisely, we discuss how the Newton polyhedron and the Hironaka polyhedron of a Weierstrass polynomial provide invariants of the singularity that reflect how ``bad" the singularities are. Here, the Hironaka polyhedron is a certain projection of the Newton polyhedron. After a brief introduction to the notions, we study the behaviour of the Hironaka polyhedron under blowing ups for curves and surfaces. Then we explain how this leads to an invariant for desingularization of surfaces in any characteristic that decreases strictly after blowing up a sufficiently nice center. We focus on the ideas and try to hide the technical details as good as possible. <br>
This is joint work with Vincent Cossart. </p>

<br>

<p> <a name=ardito> </a> <strong> Cesare Ardito (University of Manchseter): Classifying 2-blocks with an elementary abelian defect group. </strong>  Donovan's conjecture predicts that given a $p$-group $D$ there are only finitely many Morita equivalence classes of blocks of group algebras with defect group $D$. While the conjecture is still open for a generic $p$-group $D$, it has been proven in 2014 by Eaton, Kessar, K&uuml;lshammer and Sambale when $D$ is an elementary abelian 2-group, and in 2018 by Eaton and Livesey when $D$ is any abelian 2-group. The proof, however, does not describe these equivalence classes explicitly.
A classification up to Morita equivalence over a complete discrete valuation ring $\mathcal{O}$ has been achieved for $D$ with rank $3$ or less, and for $D = (C_2)^4$. <br>
I have done $(C_2)^5$, and I have partial results on $(C_2)^6$. I will introduce the topic, give the relevant definitions and then describe the process of classifying this blocks, with a particular focus on the individual tools needed to achieve a complete classification.</p>

<p> <a name=valdivieso> </a> <strong> Yadira Valdivieso D&iacute;az (University of Leicester): From the potential to the first Hochschild cohomology group of a cluster tilted algebra. </strong> The aim of this talk is to give a concrete interpretation of the dimension of the first Hochschild cohomology space of a cyclically oriented or tame cluster tilted algebra in terms of a numerical invariant arising from the potential.</p>

<br>

<p> <a name=villamizar> </a> <strong> Nelly Villamizar (Swansea University): Spline spaces on polyhedral cells. </strong> In this talk we will give a brief overview of some of the algebraic methods which are used in spline theory. We will give particular attention to the pioneering work of Billera, in which homological methods were introduced for the calculation of dimension formulas.  These methods have proved very fruitful for splines on all types of subdivisions,  we will attempt to give a flavor for the various results that have been obtained this way, the questions that remain open, and the connections to algebraic geometry that result from these methods. <br>
In particular we shall consider the space of spline functions defined on polyhedral cells. These cells are the union of 3-dimensional polytopes sharing a common vertex, so that the intersection of any two of the polytopes is a face of both. In the talk, we will present new bounds on the dimension of this spline space. We provide a bound on the contribution of the homology term to the dimension count, and prove upper and lower bounds on the ideal of the interior vertex which depend only on combinatorial (or matroidal) information of the cell. We use inverse systems to convert the problem of finding the dimension of ideals generated by powers of linear forms to a computation of dimensions of so-called fat point ideals. The fat point schemes that comes from dualizing polyhedral cells is particularly well-suited and leads to the exact dimension in many cases of interest that will also be presented in the talk. </p>

<p> <a name=lyle> </a> <strong> Sinead Lyle (University of Norwich): Decomposition matrices associated to the full transformation semigroup. </strong> The transformation monoid $T_n$ consists of all maps from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ to itself. Consider the algebra $\mathbb{C} T_n$. This algebra has dimension $n^n$ and it is not semisimplefor $n \geq 2$. However it is standardly based (in the sense of Du and Rui) and its representations are controlled by those of its maximal subgroups, the symmetric groups $S_d$ where $1 \leq d \leq n$. In this talk, we shall discuss some of the facts which are known about the representations of the transformation monoid and how they are related to those of the symmetric groups. </p>

<p> <a name=koppensteiner> </a> <strong> Clemens Koppensteiner (University of Oxford): 
D-modules in logarithmic geometry. </strong> 
Given a smooth variety X with a normal crossings divisor D (or more generally a smooth log variety) we consider the ring of logarithmic differential operators: the subring of differential operators on X generated by vector fields tangent to D. Modules over this ring are called logarithmic D-modules and generalize the classical theory of regular meromorphic connections. They arise naturally when considering compactifications. <br>

We will discuss which parts of the theory of D-modules generalize to the logarithmic setting and how to overcome new challenges arising from the logarithmic structure. In particular, we will define holonomicity and study its interaction with duality. This talk will be very example-focused and will not require any previous knowledge of D-modules or logarithmic geometry. This is joint work with Mattia Talpo. </p>

<br>
<p> <a name=broomhead> </a> <strong> Nathan Broomhead (University of Plymouth): Discrete derived categories and their thick subcategories. </strong> Discrete derived categories, as defined by Vossieck, form a class of triangulated categories in which explicit computations are possible but which are non-trivial enough to manifest interesting behaviour. In this talk, motivated by some small examples, I will explain a geometric model for discrete derived categories, which can be used to explicitly calculate their lattices of thick subcategories in terms of certain generating collections of exceptional and sphere-like objects.  </p>

<br>

<p> <a name=saunders> </a> <strong> Neil Saunders (Greenwich University): The Exotic Nilpotent Cone and Type C Combinatorics. </strong> The exotic nilpotent cone as defined by Kato gives a 'Type A-like' Springer correspondence for Type C. In particular, there is a bijection between the symplectic group orbits on the exotic nilpotent cone and the irreducible representations of the Weyl group of Type C. In this talk, I will outline the various geometric and combinatorial results that follow from this. These results are joint work with Vinoth Nanadakumar and Daniele Rosso, and Arik Wilbert. </p>

<br>

<p> <a name=monin> </a> <strong> Leonid Monin (University of Bristol): Newton polyhedra theory for overdetermined systems of Laurent polynomials. </strong>  Classical theory of Newton polyhedra calculates topological invariants of a zero set in algebraic torus of a general system of Laurent polynomials in terms of combinatorics of their Newton polyhedra. More precisely, for a fixed polytopes $P_1,...,P_k$ there exists an open dense subset $U$ of the space of Laurent polynomials with Newton polyhedra $P_1,...,P_k$ such that the topological invariant of interest is the same for any system from $U$ and can be computed combinatorially. <br>

It could be that polyhedra $P_1,...,P_k$ are such that the generic system of Laurent polynomials with Newton polytopes $P_1,...,P_k$ does not have any solutions. In this case one can be interested in invariants of generic non-empty zero set. Since in this case consistent systems are not generic, all results of classical Newton polyhedra theory are not applicable to them. In my talk I will explain how to extend theory of Newton polyhedra to the case of overdetermined systems. <br>

If time permits, I will also talk about generalization to systems on spherical homogeneous spaces and other algebraic varieties. </p>

<p> <a name=lobos> </a> <strong>  Diego Lobos Maturana (Universidad de Talca): Cellular basis for generalized blob algebras. </strong> <a href="./files/lobos-maturana-abstract.pdf"> Abstract </a> </p>

<br>

<p> <a name=cumplido> </a> <strong>  Mar&iacute;a Cumplido Cabello (Herriot-Watt University): The k-th root problem extraction for braid groups. </strong> There are several computational problems in braid groups that have been proposed for their potential applications to cryptography, even if the interest of the subject has decreased, mainly due to the appearance of algorithms which solve the conjugacy problem extremely fast in the generic case. However, there are some other problems in braid groups whose generic-case complexity is still to be studied. This is the case of the k-th root (extraction) problem. In this talk we will see that, generically, finding the k-th root of a braid is very fast, and we will describe an algorithm to do so. </p>

<h2> Abstracts </h2> 
<p> <a name=shah> </a> <strong> Amit Shah (University of Leeds): Partial cluster-tilted algebras, quasi-abelian hearts and Auslander-Reiten theory.

</strong> A partial cluster-tilted algebra is defined as an endomorphism ring of a rigid object R of a cluster category <strong> C </strong> (associated to a finite-dimensional hereditary algebra over a field). The representation theory of this kind of algebra is harder to get to than the representation theory of the related cluster-tilted algebra. Buan and Marsh showed that if A is the endomorphism ring of a rigid object R in <strong>C </strong>, then one needs to perform two steps to get to the module category <strong>mod</strong> A. First, you quotient <strong>C</strong> by the subcategory <strong>X</strong>=Ker(How(R,-)), and then you localise (in the sense of Gabriel and ZIsman) the integral category <strong>C</strong>/<strong>X</strong> at the class of regular morphisms. The resultant category is equivalent to <strong>mod</strong> A.

In order to understand <strong>mod</strong> A from <strong>C</strong>, my recent strategy has been to better understand <strong>C</strong>/<strong>X</strong>. In this talk, I will show that one can use Nakaoka’s theory of twin cotorsion pairs to show that <strong>C</strong>/<strong>X</strong> is a quasi-abelian category (i.e. has kernels and cokernels, and pullbacks of cokernels are cokernels and pushouts of kernels are kernels), and then I will give a characterisation of Auslander-Reiten sequences in such a category. At the beginning I will quickly define the cluster category, and throughout the talk there will be a simple running example to demonstrate what’s happening.</p>

<br>

<p> <a name=webster> </a> <strong> Isobel Webster (University of Leeds): A lattice isomorphism theorem for cluster groups of type A </strong> Each quiver appearing in a seed of a cluster algebra determines a corresponding group, which we call a cluster group, which is defined via a presentation. Grant and Marsh showed that, for quivers that are mutationally equivalent to oriented simply-laced <u> Dynkin </u> diagrams, the associated cluster groups are isomorphic to finite reflection groups and thus are finite <u> Coxeter </u> groups. There are many well-established results for <u> Coxeter </u> presentations and we are interested in whether the cluster group presentations possess comparable properties.


I will define a cluster group associated to a cluster quiver and explain how the theory of cluster algebras forms the basis of research into cluster groups. As for <u> Coxeter </u> groups, we can consider parabolic subgroups of cluster groups. I will outline a proof which shows that, in the mutation-<u> Dynkin </u> type A case, there exists an isomorphism between the lattice of subsets of the defining generators of the cluster group and the lattice of its parabolic subgroups.</p>

<p> <a name=august> </a> <strong> Jenny August (University of Edinburgh): The Tilting Theory of Contraction Algebras. </strong> Contraction algebras are a class of finite dimensional, symmetric algebras introduced by Donovan and Wemyss as a tool to study the minimal model program in geometry.  In this talk, I will give an introduction to these algebras, before then going on to describe how an associated hyperplane arrangement (a simple picture) coming from the two-term tilting theory controls something that, for a general algebra, is considered extremely complicated; namely, the entire derived equivalence class of such an algebra.</p>

<br>

<p> <a name=damiani> </a> <strong> Celeste Damiani (University of Leeds): Remarkable quotients of virtual braid groups.</strong> <i>Virtual braid groups</i> are one of the most famous generalisations of braid groups. Among their remarkable quotients we have <i>loop/welded braid groups $LB_n$</i> and <i>unrestricted virtual braid groups $UVB_n$</i>. We describe the group structure of unrestricted virtual braid groups as right-angled Artin groups, and explore some applications to fused links, such as the definition of a <i>fused link group</i> through a representation for $UVB_n$ in the group of automorphisms of the free $2$-step nilpotent group of rank $n$. </p>

<br>

<p> <a name=mcleay> </a> <strong> Alan Mcleay (Universit&eacute; du Luxembourg): Mapping class groups, covers, and braids. </strong> 
The mapping class group of a surface is the group of isotopy classes of boundary preserving homeomorphisms of the surface. Given a finite sheeted covering space between surfaces, we may ask what relationship, if any, exists between the two mapping class groups?
In joint work with Tyrone Ghaswala we investigate this question for surfaces with non-empty boundary.  I will discuss a classical theorem of Birman-Hilden and give new insight into a family of covering spaces related to the Burau representation of braid groups.

<p> <a name=page> </a> <strong> Janet Page (University of Bristol): Symbolic vs. ordinary powers and the containment problem for Hibi rings. </strong> The relationship between symbolic powers and ordinary powers of prime ideals is an active area of research in commutative algebra.  It is easily verified that n-th ordinary power of a prime ideal is contained in its $n$-th symbolic power, and typically we strive for containments in the other direction.  In characteristic 0, Ein, Lazarsfeld, and Smith showed there is a uniform containment which holds for every prime ideal in a regular ring $R$.  Namely, they showed that there is a $d$ (in this case the dimension of $R$) such that for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ in $R$, we have that the $dn$-th symbolic power of $\mathfrak{p}$ is contained in its $n$-th ordinary power.  Since then, this result has been extended to characteristic $p$ by Hochster and Huneke and much more recently to mixed characteristic by Ma and Schwede, but there are still few results known in the non regular case.  In this talk, I will review the background of this problem and discuss new results (joint with Daniel Smolkin and Kevin Tucker) in this direction, by introducing a class of toric rings called Hibi rings, which can be combinatorially defined in terms of finite posets.</p>

<br>

<p> <a name=hering> </a> <strong> Milena Hering (University of Edinburgh): The F-splitting ratio of a toric variety. </strong> The Frobenius morphism is a useful tool in the study of commutative rings and algebraic varieties. One of its uses is to give a measurement of how bad the singularities of a ring are. This measurement is called the the F-splitting ratio, which agrees with the  F-signature for normal rings. The F-signature of a normal toric ring was computed by Von Korff. I will give give an introduction to these notions and present the computation of the F-splitting ratio of a seminormal toric ring. This is joint work with Kevin Tucker.</p>

<br>


<p> <a name=logares> </a> <strong> Marina Logares (University of Plymouth): Integrable systems and Higgs bundles.</strong> The moduli space of Higgs bundles is a rich geometric object which lies in the interface of algebraic geometry, differential geometry and mathematical physics. One of its properties is that it carries the structure of an algebraic completely integrable system known as the Hitchin system. We will talk about the Hitchin system and discuss a variation of it providing a complex partially integrable system. This talk is based on joint work with I. Biswas and A. Peón-Nieto.</p>

<br>



<p> <a name=allegretti> </a> <strong> Dylan Allegretti (University of Sheffield): Quiver representations, cluster varieties, and categorification of canonical bases.</strong> Associated to a compact oriented surface with marked points on its boundary is an interesting class of finite-dimensional algebras. These algebras are examples of gentle algebras, and their representation theory has been studied by many authors in connection with the theory of cluster algebras. An important fact about these algebras is that their indecomposable modules come in two types: string modules, which correspond to arcs connecting marked points on the surface, and band modules, which correspond to closed loops on the surface. Thanks to the work of many mathematicians, the string modules are known to categorify generators of a cluster algebra. In this talk, I will explain how, by including band modules in this story, one can define a family of graded vector spaces which categorify Fock and Goncharov's canonical basis for the algebra of functions on an associated cluster variety. These vector spaces are of interest in mathematical physics, where they are expected to provide a mathematical definition of the space of framed BPS states from the work of Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke.</p>


<br>

<p> <a name=szymik> </a> <strong> Markus Szymik (NTNU): Symmetry groups of algebraic structures and their homology. </strong> The symmetric groups, the general linear groups, and the automorphism groups of free groups are examples of families of groups that arise as symmetry groups of algebraic structures but that are also dear to topologists. There are many other less obvious examples of interest. For instance, in joint work with Nathalie Wahl, this point of view has led to the computation of the homology of the Higman-Thompson groups. I will survey a general context and some other geometric examples in this talk.</p>
